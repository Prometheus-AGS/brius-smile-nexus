**Date**: Current session  
**Rationale**: 
- Different AI assistants have different strengths and use cases
- Maintaining consistency across tools ensures predictable development experience
- Provides flexibility to switch between assistants based on task requirements
- Reduces vendor lock-in and provides redundancy options

**Implementation**:
- Created `.clinerules` for Cline AI assistant
- Created `.roorules` and mode-specific files for Roo Code
- Created `.kilocode/rules/` directory structure for Kilo Code
- Maintained identical standards and patterns across all configurations

### Memory Bank System Architecture
**Decision**: Implement persistent context management through Memory Bank markdown files  
**Date**: Current session  
**Rationale**:
- AI assistants have limited context windows and lose conversation history
- Complex projects require persistent context across multiple development sessions

**Alternatives Considered**: npm, pnpm  
**Trade-offs**: Additional tool dependency vs. npm's universal availability

## TypeScript Configuration Decisions

### Strict Type Safety Policy
**Decision**: Zero tolerance for `any` types (explicit or implicit)  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- Maximum type safety prevents runtime errors and improves code quality
- Better IDE support with comprehensive autocomplete and error detection
- Easier refactoring and maintenance with compile-time error checking
- Forces proper interface design and API contracts
- Improves code documentation through type definitions

**Implementation**:
- Strict TypeScript configuration with all strict flags enabled
- ESLint rules to prevent `any` type usage
- Comprehensive interface definitions for all data structures
- Proper generic type usage and utility types

### Interface-First Development
**Decision**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementing components  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- Establishes clear contracts between components and data structures
- Enables parallel development of frontend and backend features
- Improves code review process with clear type expectations
- Reduces integration issues and runtime type errors
- Facilitates better testing with known data structures

## State Management Decisions

### Zustand Selection
**Decision**: Zustand for primary state management  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and flexible compared to Redux or Context API
- Excellent TypeScript support with minimal boilerplate
- Simple API that's easy to learn and maintain
- Good performance with selective subscriptions
- Supports both simple and complex state management scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**: Redux Toolkit, Context API, Jotai  
**Trade-offs**: Smaller ecosystem vs. Redux's extensive tooling

### Hook-Based Store Access Pattern
**Decision**: Components must access stores only through custom hooks  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- Provides abstraction layer between components and store implementation
- Enables easier testing with hook mocking capabilities
- Allows for store logic encapsulation and reusability
- Prevents direct store manipulation and maintains data flow integrity
- Facilitates store refactoring without component changes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// ❌ Prohibited - Direct store access
const Component = () => {
  const store = useStore();
  return <div>{store.data}</div>;
};

// ✅ Required - Hook-based access
const useData = () => {
  const data = useStore(state => state.data);
  const setData = useStore(state => state.setData);
  return { data, setData };
};
```

## UI Component Strategy Decisions

### shadcn/ui Component Library Selection
**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui as primary UI component library  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- High-quality, accessible components with modern design
- Copy-paste approach provides full control over component code
- Excellent Tailwind CSS integration and customization options
- Strong TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Active maintenance and regular updates

**Alternatives Considered**: Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI  
**Trade-offs**: Smaller component library vs. comprehensive UI frameworks

### Component Usage Policy
**Decision**: Prefer shadcn/ui components over raw HTML elements  
**Date**: Project inception  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent styling and behavior across application
- Provides built-in accessibility features and ARIA compliance
