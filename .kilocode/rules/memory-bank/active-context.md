# Active Context - Current Session State

## Current Session Goals
- Complete Kilo Code AI assistant configuration setup
- Finalize mode-specific rules and Memory Bank structure
- Ensure consistency across all AI assistant configurations (Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code)
- Prepare project for AI-assisted development with comprehensive rule sets

## Current Focus Areas

### Configuration Completion
- âœ… Created global rules file (`.kilocode/rules/global.md`)
- âœ… Created architect mode rules (`.kilocode/rules/architect.md`)
- âœ… Created code implementation rules (`.kilocode/rules/code.md`)
- âœ… Created debug mode rules (`.kilocode/rules/debug.md`)
- âœ… Created test mode rules (`.kilocode/rules/test.md`)
- âœ… Created Memory Bank directory structure
- ðŸ”„ Currently setting up Memory Bank files for persistent context

### Memory Bank Structure
- Project Brief: High-level project overview and technology stack
- Active Context: Current session state and immediate goals
- Product Context: Detailed project architecture and principles
- Progress Tracking: Completed work and upcoming tasks
- Decision Log: Architectural and technical decisions
- System Patterns: Reusable code patterns and templates

## Recent Decisions Made

### Kilo Code Configuration Strategy
- Adopted `.kilocode/rules/` directory structure instead of single file
- Created mode-specific rules files for different development phases
- Integrated Memory Bank system for persistent AI context management
- Maintained consistency with existing Cline and Roo Code configurations

### Rule Integration Approach
- Consolidated all original standards from `.clinerules` into Kilo Code format
- Adapted Roo Code patterns and Memory Bank structure for Kilo Code
- Ensured all three AI assistants have equivalent rule coverage
- Maintained strict TypeScript and development standards across all configurations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Memory Bank file creation for Kilo Code
2. Verify consistency across all AI assistant configurations
3. Document final configuration structure and usage patterns
4. Prepare for actual feature development using established rules

### Upcoming Development
- Begin implementing core application features using established patterns
- Test AI assistant behavior with new rule configurations
- Refine rules based on actual development experience
- Maintain Memory Bank files with ongoing project context

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring rule consistency across three different AI assistant formats
- Balancing comprehensive rules with practical development efficiency
- Managing Memory Bank updates across multiple AI assistant systems
- Coordinating between different AI assistant configuration approaches

## Session State
- **Phase**: Configuration and setup completion
- **Priority**: High - Foundation for all future development
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Dependencies**: All AI assistant configurations must be complete before development begins

## Context for Next Session
When resuming development, the focus should shift from configuration to actual feature implementation using the established rules and patterns. All three AI assistants (Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code) should now have comprehensive rule sets that enforce:

- Strict TypeScript usage (no `any` types)
- Zustand state management with hook-based access
- shadcn/ui component usage over raw HTML
- kebab-case file naming conventions
- Supabase integration best practices
- Comprehensive testing and error handling
- Performance optimization and accessibility standards

The Memory Bank system should be actively maintained to preserve context across AI-assisted development sessions.
