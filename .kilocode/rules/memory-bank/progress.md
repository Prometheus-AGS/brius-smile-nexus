### Standards Established
- **Technology Stack**: React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Zustand, Supabase
- **Package Manager**: Yarn for all dependency management
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with zero `any` type usage
- **State Management**: Zustand with mandatory hook-based access patterns
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui preferred over raw HTML elements
- **File Naming**: kebab-case convention for all files
- **Backend Integration**: Supabase for auth, database, and real-time features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and strict development standards

## Current Sprint: Configuration Completion

### In Progress
- üîÑ Finalizing Kilo Code Memory Bank structure
- üîÑ Creating remaining Memory Bank files for persistent context
- üîÑ Ensuring consistency across all AI assistant configurations

### Recently Completed

- ‚úÖ Established Kilo Code Memory Bank directory structure
- ‚úÖ Created project-brief.md for Kilo Code Memory Bank
- ‚úÖ Created active-context.md for current session tracking
- ‚úÖ Created product-context.md for high-level project information

## Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 2: Memory Bank Completion (CURRENT)
- üîÑ Complete decision-log.md for Kilo Code Memory Bank
- üîÑ Complete system-patterns.md for Kilo Code Memory Bank
- ‚è≥ Verify consistency across all AI assistant configurations
- ‚è≥ Document final configuration structure and usage patterns

### Phase 3: Development Preparation (NEXT)
- ‚è≥ Set up initial project structure with Vite and React 19
- ‚è≥ Configure TypeScript with strict settings
- ‚è≥ Install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- ‚è≥ Set up Zustand store structure and patterns
- ‚è≥ Configure Supabase integration and authentication
- ‚è≥ Set up testing framework with Vitest and React Testing Library

### Phase 4: Core Feature Development (PLANNED)
- ‚è≥ Implement authentication system with Supabase
- ‚è≥ Create core UI components using shadcn/ui
- ‚è≥ Develop main application features and functionality
- ‚è≥ Implement comprehensive testing suite
- ‚è≥ Set up deployment and CI/CD pipeline

## Blockers and Challenges

### Current Blockers
- **None identified** - Configuration phase proceeding smoothly

### Resolved Challenges
- ‚úÖ **AI Assistant Compatibility**: Successfully adapted rules for three different AI assistants
- ‚úÖ **Rule Consistency**: Maintained consistent standards across all configurations
- ‚úÖ **Memory Bank Structure**: Established effective persistent context management
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Complexity**: Balanced comprehensive rules with practical usability

### Potential Future Challenges
- **Rule Maintenance**: Keeping rules synchronized across multiple AI assistants
- **Development Efficiency**: Balancing strict standards with development speed
- **Context Management**: Maintaining Memory Bank files across development sessions
- **Testing Integration**: Ensuring comprehensive testing without slowing development

## Key Metrics and Achievements

### Configuration Coverage
- **3 AI Assistants**: Comprehensive rules for Cline, Roo Code, and Kilo Code
- **15+ Rule Files**: Detailed configuration files across all assistants
- **100% Standard Coverage**: All original requirements implemented across configurations
- **Memory Bank System**: Persistent context management for advanced AI assistance

### Quality Standards Achieved
- **Zero `any` Types**: Strict TypeScript enforcement across all configurations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Testing standards and patterns established
- **Security Standards**: Authentication and data security patterns defined
- **Performance Standards**: Optimization and monitoring patterns established
- **Accessibility Standards**: UI accessibility requirements and patterns defined

## Notes and Observations

### Configuration Insights
- Kilo Code's directory-based approach provides better organization than single files
- Memory Bank systems significantly improve AI context retention across sessions
- Mode-specific rules allow for targeted AI behavior in different development phases
- Consistent rule structure across assistants enables easy switching between tools

### Development Readiness
- All three AI assistants now have equivalent rule coverage and standards
- Memory Bank systems provide persistent context for complex development sessions
- Comprehensive patterns and examples reduce need for repeated explanations
- Strict standards ensure consistent code quality regardless of AI assistant used

### Next Session Preparation
- Configuration phase is nearly complete and ready for development transition
- All necessary files and structures are in place for AI-assisted development
- Memory Bank files should be actively maintained during development sessions
- Focus can shift from configuration to actual feature implementation

This progress tracking will be updated regularly to maintain accurate development status and context for future AI-assisted development sessions.
