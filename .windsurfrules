# Windsurf AI Development Rules
# Comprehensive coding standards and practices for this project
# Consolidated from .clinerules, .roorules, .kilocode/rules, and mode-specific rules

## Technology Stack Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 - Use latest features and patterns
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7 - Leverage fast build times and modern development experience
- **Package Manager**: Yarn - Use for all package management operations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - Utility-first approach for rapid development
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui - High-quality, accessible component library
- **Routing**: React Router - Modern client-side routing
- **State Management**: Zustand - Lightweight, flexible state management
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase - Full-stack solution with auth, database, real-time

## TypeScript Standards

### Strict Type Safety
- **NEVER** use the `any` type explicitly or implicitly
- Always provide proper type definitions for all functions and variables
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with all strict flags enabled
- Prefer type inference where appropriate but be explicit when needed
- Use generic types and utility types for better type safety
- Create proper interfaces for all data structures

### Type Definition Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Proper interface definition
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// ❌ Bad - Using any type
const user: any = getUserData();

// ✅ Good - Generic type usage
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  error?: string;
  loading: boolean;
}
```

## State Management Architecture

### Zustand Store Rules
- Components must **NEVER** communicate directly with stores
- Always create custom hooks to interface with Zustand stores
- Implement proper store slicing for large applications
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all store state definitions
- Implement proper store persistence when needed

### Required Pattern Implementation
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Direct store access in component
const Component = () => {
  const store = useStore();
  return <div>{store.data}</div>;
};

// ✅ Correct - Hook-based access pattern
const useUserData = () => {
  const user = useUserStore(state => state.user);
  const setUser = useUserStore(state => state.setUser);
  const isLoading = useUserStore(state => state.isLoading);
  
  return { user, setUser, isLoading };
};

const Component = () => {
  const { user, isLoading } = useUserData();
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;
};
```

## UI Component Standards

### shadcn/ui Component Priority
- **ALWAYS** prefer shadcn/ui components over raw HTML elements
- Use shadcn components for: buttons, inputs, forms, dialogs, cards, tables, etc.
- Only use raw HTML for semantic elements: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
- Maintain consistent styling through Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow shadcn/ui theming and customization patterns

### Component Usage Examples
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Using shadcn/ui components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

const LoginForm = () => (
  <Card className="p-6">
    <Input type="email" placeholder="Email" />
    <Button type="submit">Login</Button>
  </Card>
);

// ❌ Bad - Using raw HTML elements
const LoginForm = () => (
  <div className="border p-6">
    <input type="email" placeholder="Email" />
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </div>
);
```

## File Naming Conventions

### Mandatory kebab-case Usage
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with dashes) for **ALL** file names
- Apply to components, utilities, services, pages, and all other files
- No exceptions - maintain consistency across the entire project

### File Naming Examples
```
✅ Correct naming:
- user-profile.tsx
- auth-service.ts
- login-form.tsx
- api-client.ts
- user-dashboard.tsx
- payment-processor.ts

❌ Incorrect naming:
- UserProfile.tsx
- authService.ts
- LoginForm.tsx
- apiClient.ts
- userDashboard.tsx
- PaymentProcessor.ts
```

## Supabase Integration Standards

### Authentication & Database
- Use Supabase for all authentication, authorization, and database operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all Supabase operations
- Use Supabase's built-in security features (RLS policies, auth guards)
- Follow Supabase best practices for client-side operations
- Always handle loading and error states for async operations
- Implement proper real-time subscriptions when needed

### Required Implementation Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Proper Supabase integration
const useAuth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
        email,
        password,
      });
      if (error) throw error;
      setUser(data.user);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Authentication failed');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return { user, loading, error, signIn };
};
```

## Code Quality Requirements

- Mock Supabase operations properly in all tests
- Maintain good test coverage for critical business logic paths
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Code Generation Validation Requirements

### Mandatory Validation
- **MANDATORY**: Before generating any code, validate using:
  1. **Tavily MCP Server**: Search for current best practices and API changes
  2. **Context7 MCP Server**: Verify correct API versions and implementation patterns
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the specified stack versions
- Verify that generated code follows current framework conventions
- Check for any breaking changes or deprecated patterns

## Memory Bank Integration

## Additional Development Rules

### Bug Fix Memory Management
- After fixing any bugs where there are no errors detected, create a memory in the memory MCP server related to the bug fix, so we do not repeat bugs
- Document the root cause, solution, and prevention strategy for future reference
- Include relevant code patterns and anti-patterns in the memory

### Documentation Compliance
- The `docs` subdirectory in this project contains markdown files that describe architectural, design and other decisions related to the project
- Always check for files in the `docs` directory and subdirectories when generating code to make sure those rules and standards are followed
- Reference existing documentation before making architectural decisions
- Update documentation when making significant changes

### TypeScript Type Management
- Always check to see if new TypeScript types are generated already before creating new ones, so we prevent duplicate types from being created
- Use the `src/types/*` directory structure to create new types that should be shared across stores and components
- Check existing type definitions in `src/types/` before creating new interfaces or types
- Organize types by domain/feature within the types directory
- Use proper barrel exports from type files for clean imports

## Compliance and Standards

### Code Standards Enforcement
- All rules are **mandatory** for all code generation and development
- Every piece of code must adhere to these standards without exception
- Maintain consistency across the entire project
- Regular code reviews to ensure compliance
- Automated tooling to enforce standards where possible

Remember: These rules are **mandatory** for all code generation, architectural planning, and development work. Every decision and implementation must align with these established standards and practices.
