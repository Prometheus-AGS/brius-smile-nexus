# Active Context

## Current Session Goals
- Set up Roo Code configuration files and Memory Bank structure
- Establish development standards and coding rules
- Prepare project for AI-assisted development workflow

## Current Focus
Setting up comprehensive Roo Code configuration with:
- Global rules (.roorules)
- Mode-specific rules for architect, code, debug, and test modes
- Memory Bank structure for persistent context management
- Project brief for initial context

## Recent Decisions
- Adopted Roo Code over Cline for AI-assisted development
- Implemented Memory Bank structure for better context persistence
- Created mode-specific rules for different development phases
- Established comprehensive coding standards

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Test Roo Code configuration with different modes
2. Begin using Memory Bank files for context tracking
3. Start implementing features using established patterns
4. Update Memory Bank files as development progresses

## Current Challenges
- None identified at this time

## Session State
- Configuration phase: Complete
- Ready for development workflow implementation
